## Getting Started

### Steps to run the project

- Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

- **`!!! Make sure to have installed Sanity globally`**
  Check sanity docs for more info: https://www.sanity.io/docs/getting-started-with-sanity-cli

!!! Please, take into account that you need to create a token in Sanity Studio, and put it in NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_TOKEN.

Also, the points from 2 to 5 are queries to get data from Sanity. It's up to you to create them. Otherwise, you can use your own queries.

- Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
